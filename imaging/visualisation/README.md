# Visualisation

The somite length and counts were measured manually on HCR images. The results were stored into csv and [this quarto](./Somite_plots.qmd) is used to generate box plots available [here](../../output.files/imaging/visualisation/somite.numbers.pdf) and [here](../../output.files/imaging/visualisation/somite.sizes.pdf).
