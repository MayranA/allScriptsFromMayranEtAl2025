# Profiles

The medial axis was manually drawn on ImageJ from posterior to anterior. This axis was widened by 100-150 pixels depending on the width of the analysed gastruloids to cover most of the gastruloid surface and fluorescence for each channel was quantified along this axis. The results are in the csv files of this directory.

Then the analysis was done with [this R script](./IF.profile.Plot.R) and the output plots are [here](../../output.files/imaging/profiles/).
